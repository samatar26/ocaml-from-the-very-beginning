  Questions
1. Design a new type rect for representing rectangles. Treat squares as a special case.
2. Now write a function of type rect â†’ int to calculate the area of a given rect.
3. Write a function which rotates a rect such that it is at least as tall as it is wide.
4. Use this function to write one which, given a rect list, returns another such list which has the
smallest total width and whose members are sorted widest first.
5. Write take , drop , and map functions for the sequence type.
6. Extend the expr type and the evaluate function to allow raising a number to a power.
7. Use the option type to deal with the problem that Division_by_zero may be raised from the
evaluate function.
