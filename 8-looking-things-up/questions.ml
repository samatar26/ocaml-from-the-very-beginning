  Questions
1. Write a function to determine the number of different keys in a dictionary.
2. Define a function replace which is like add , but raises Not_found if the key is not already there.
3. Write a function to build a dictionary from two equal length lists, one containing keys and another
containing values. Raise the exception Invalid_argument if the lists are not of equal length.
4. Now write the inverse function: given a dictionary, return the pair of two lists â€“ the first containing
all the keys, and the second containing all the values.
5. Define a function to turn any list of pairs into a dictionary. If duplicate keys are found, the value
associated with the first occurrence of the key should be kept.
6. Write the function union a b which forms the union of two dictionaries. The union of two dictio-
naries is the dictionary containing all the entries in one or other or both. In the case that a key is
contained in both dictionaries, the value in the first should be preferred.

let rec contains k d = 
  match d with 
    [] -> false 
  | (k', v')::t -> k = k' || contains k t


let rec unique_keys_inner d n l = 
  match d with 
    [] -> n 
  | (k, v)::t -> 
    if contains k l
    then unique_keys_inner t n l 
    else  unique_keys_inner t (n+1) ((k, v)::l) 

let unique_keys d = 
  unique_keys_inner d 0 []

(* 
  Since the keys must be unique in a dictionary, number of different keys is simple the length of the list
  representing the dictionary, so we can just use the usual length function.
